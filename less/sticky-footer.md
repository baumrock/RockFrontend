# RockFrontend sticky footer

## Usage

- load the less file in your project
- add the class `.rf-sticky-footer` to the container that holds the `<header>`, `<footer>` and `<main>` element

## Notes

Many quick fix solutions provided on the internet will only work with fixed footer heights or rely on JavaScript. This solution needs no JavaScript at all and does also work on mobile devices where the address bar takes up a small portion of the screen height and some other solutions don't account for that issue.
