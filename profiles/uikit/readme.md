## UIkit Profile

This profile is my default setup. It comes with the following features/benefits:

* It loads UIkit CSS/JS files directly from the core (but you can use your own version if you want)
* It uses the Less module to parse LESS files whenever they change (but you don't need to use LESS if you don't want)
* Live reloading whenever a file changes - this works with all files (LESS, LATTE, PHP, JS) both on the frontend and on the backend!
* ALFRED - A lovely frontend editor - add links to edit markup directly in your IDE
* ZERO setup! No complicated frontend build tools like NPM, WebPack etc...
* It is based on LATTE template files. Latte is a great template engine that feels like PHP and makes your markup cleaner and safer

Note that you need to install LATTE once via composer (composer require latte/latte).

The default layout for this profile is a boxed layout that has a header, a main section and a footer. The footer is kept on the bottom of the page no matter how much content the main section takes up (this is a concept that I need on every website).
